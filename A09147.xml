         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>gates of Hell cannot preuaile neyther infidelity to haue acceſſe, Cyp. Epiſt. 55. ad comm.

For in the dayes of the Apostles there wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted not moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heretickes, as <hi>Simon Magus, Her nogines, Philectus, Hymenaeus, Alexander, &amp; Nicolaus:</hi> who are mentioned in the Scripture, to haue wauered, and been inconstant in the faith: and after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of righteouſnes to haue turned back from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and to haue maintayned erroneous opinions, and teached falſe doctrine for lucre cauſe.

So that to this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t day, there hath been no age free of Hereſie, neyther was the world ſo perfect in Faith and Religion in the dayes
<pb facs="tcp:2004:8"/>of the Apoſtles more then now: neyther is the world ſo perfect yet, as not to haue many ſimple people in it; neyther is the ſimple people ſo happy, as to keepe themſelues ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humble, and in the obedience of the doctrine of the Church; neyther is the obedient fully ſecure not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, of ſubtill and crafty men; neyther is the ſubtill &amp; crafty Heretick ſo carefull of his credit &amp; honeſty to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat his peruerſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and malice, to ſpare and forbeare to maintain ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſhoods, &amp; old dampned opinions, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle, and ſnare the ignorantes, and ſimple people. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle prognosticates Hereſies to be that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ben forewarnde and fortold, that as Hereſies muſt be, &amp; with it ſubtility and malice that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men beholde the one, to be circumſpect not to be deceaued, and trapped in the other, againſt whom Chriſt our Saluiour exhortes vs totake head of falſe Prophets who are clothed in ſheape ſkinnes and are inwardly reaweing wolues, Matth. 7. And S. Iohn biddes not belieue euery ſpirit, but try them, and decerne them whether they be of God, or no? But who is this prudent, and wyſe, that can not be deceaued? and who hath that gift to decerne spirits? ſeing Hereſie it ſelfe is of the Scripture, and deceit and malice is of the diuell, that old ſerpent, for made not Sathan this potion out of Scripture, when he ſaid Gen. <hi>3. Eritis ſicut dij,</hi> his deceat and malice is

I wiſh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my hart (if it pleaſe God) that as holy Scripture is the true tryall therof, that it were as euident and plaine to all men to ſeike the tryall therin, which the whole learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; holy men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles tymes, hath iudged the contrary, that the Scripture is a book of difficulties as S Auſt. ſaith, <hi>lib. 2. de doct.

In this ſame mynd is <hi>S Hier. in Ezech. cap. 45.</hi> ſaying, All pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie and interpretation of the Scriptute containes the truth in darknes and obſcurity, to the intent that the ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers &amp; learned within, may vuderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but the rude people without, may not know what is ſaid, leaſt we ſhould caſt precious perles before hoges, if the treaſure of Gods ſecrets,
<pb facs="tcp:2004:9"/>should be opened to euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To amplifie at more lenght, the difficultie therof, <hi>Epiph. in Anchoratu,</hi> ſaies, The Scripture telleth all truth, but we haue need of a good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and perſeuerance to know God, and his word. Lykewyſe, <hi>Orig lib. 7. in leuit.</hi> There is in the Goſpel, ſaith he, the letter that killeth; and this deſtroying letre is not only in the old, buc alſo in the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to him that vnderſtandes it not ſpiritually what is ſaid. VVhich difficultie <hi>Tert. in praeſc</hi> affirmes, ſaying, I am not a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſay, that the Scriptures themſelues haue been ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the will of God, that they might miniſter matter vnto Heretickes. And therfore ſeing the Apoſtle progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticates that Hereſie muſt be, which could not be without the Scripture, which is an ample field for all ſectes, the greater ſhould be our prudence and wiſdome to beweere of their deceat and ſubtilities, leſt they bring to paſſe which S. Paul feared ſaying, that as the Serpent deceaued Eua through his ſubtility, euen ſo your ſenſes may be corrupted and to fall away from the ſimplicity vvhich is in Chriſt Ieſu. For ſuch falſe Apoſtles are decetfull workers tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurating themſelues in the Apoſtles of Chriſt. Neyther is it marueil that they ſo appeare, for their maſter Sathan can tranſfigure himſelfe in an Angell of light, therfore it is not a great matter, if his miniſters can tranſfigurat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Contrary to this, the Papiſts place their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Hope firme, and ſure, becauſe on his part in whome we hope, it is moſt certayne, that is to ſay, it is moſt certayne on Gods part, that there ſhall want nothing, for obtayning of that, which vve hope for. For this cauſe, hope is called aſſured and certaine, becauſe it leanes to a moſt ſure fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament, to wit, the Heauenly promiſes, and help of God, by which aſſuredly, we are conducted to ſaluation, if ſecondly for our part, we ſhall vſe diligence, to work with the ſame to our power, as is ſayd in the counſell of Trente ſeſſ. 6. cap. 13. vvhere ſpeaking of the gift of perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, it ſaith, let no man promiſe to himſelf ſecurity, by abſolute certitude, and aſſurance, but in Gods help all are to be repoſed, and with firme hope vvorking our ſaluation. Where it is ſuppoſed, that it is in our power in apart, that vve fayle not, or that vve vvork not vvith his graces as vve ſhould do. And as it is in the gift of perſeuerance, euen ſo it is in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2004:121"/>the hope of our ſaluation. For if truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it were not in our power to cooperat, &amp; worke with the diuine power of God, we ſhould haue no more place to hope in God, then if we wanted him, and that there were not a God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our hope is ſure, and confident in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is omnipotent, and faithfull in his promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as the pſ. 144. v. 15 ſayth, The Lord is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all his wordes, and holy in all his workes, to wit what lyeth on Gods part, for this cauſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it followeth, that our Lord vpholdes thoſe that be weake, &amp; lifteth vp thoſe that are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Againe pſ. 145. it is ſayd; Bleſſed is he, that hath the God of Iacob for his helpe, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God, which made the Heavens &amp; the earth, the ſea, and all that there in is, who kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth faithfulnes for euer.</p>
                  <p>Lykewyſe Eccl, 2. v. 11. No man hath hoped in the Lord, and is aſhamed. For God helpeth euer, ſo that the certitude of our hope, conſiſteth in this, that it is aſſured on Gods part, for our ſaluation, becauſe his grace is ready, if we cooperate, and worke therewith, and ſo rightly is vnderſtood, that ſaying of the Apoſtle, that hope is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and this hope which the Catholickes belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, is far diſcrepant, to the temerous preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the proteſtantes, who are ſo certainly perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and aſſured, that they confide in themſelues, more then in God, &amp; whatſoeuer thing they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade, and aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of, God muſt be bound to follow their opinion.

For the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſongs, are not inſtituted to inſtruct the people, in their vnderſtanding with wordes, but it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to awake and ſturr vp their myndes, to the worſhip of God, by ſwet Harmony, Reuerence, Maieſty, and ſolemne actions.

It is to be thought, that all nations had a common tongue as <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. in which God was ſerued, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion of to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues being made, three ſpeciall tongues, are ſeparat, &amp; inſtitute for the diuine ſeruice of God, whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this cuſtome followeth, that in the occidentall Churches the vſe of the latin to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue was euer with them, which was a naturall tongue to them, and althought it was not altogeather common, to all nations, for diuerſe nations, and tongues, were included in the occidentall Churche, and yet for diuine ſeruice, this tongue is moſt frequently vſed.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2004:123"/>So the Greek church, vſeth the Greek and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daick, and yet the Greek and chaldaick is another tongue, different from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon tongue, which the people vſeth in their meettings, but the others were vſed only amongſt the learned, and with the Prieſts, in diuyne ſeruice.

                  <p>THE Apoſtles ſaying, contaynes a threefold prayer, to wit, the prayer of the mouth, of the ſpirit, and mynd, to which, theſe three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, the tongue, the will, and vnderſtanding, therefore if any pray with his mouth, in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, he prayeth with mouth and wil, if he do it for Gods cauſe, but his mynd is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit, to wit, that he vnderſtandes not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what he prayeth, he vnderſtandes not, in the meane tyme, his prayer is not without fruit, for it is meritorious to him that prayeth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, albeit it be deſtitute of that fruit, which men conceaue by vnderſtanding. And therefore S. Paul ſtriueth to declare the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, which is the gift of the expoſition of holy Scriptures, &amp; of the wordes of prayer, to be more excellent, then the gift of the tongue. For ſeing dayly the nomber of the faithful increaſed both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt Ethnicks, &amp; Iewes, to the fayth of Chriſt, it was not requiſit to the faithfull, to ſpeake before them, with many tongues, but then it was their part to ſpeak with interpretation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, without which they vnderſtood not the Scriptures. But now, when men are taught in the faith of Chriſt, and with continuall preaching of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2004:125"/>the word, what ſeruice, or prayers are in the Church, that men are ignorant of? Therefore to what end ſhould diuyne ſeruice be done in a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue, ſeing it is not vnknowne to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, what is done in the Maſſe, or ſonges of the Church; whilſt they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme their geſtures to the wordes of the Prieſt, now to ſtand, now to bowe their kne, now to left vp their handes, and eyes, now to knok on their brieſts &amp;c? But to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the heretick propoundeth againſt the Maſſe, and Church mattens, we anſwere that S. Paul ſpeakes of a Prophet, Preacher, or Doctor, to interprete the Scriptures, as Hierome, &amp; Auſten witnes in this place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly that albeit the lay-men vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not the wordes, yet notwithſtanding they vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all the myſteries, by preaching. Therfore the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of maſſe, and matines, and euen ſonge is not vnprofitable &amp;c. howbeit they vnderſtand not the wordes, for theſe reaſons. Becauſe in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne ſeruice of the Church, vſually is read the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, by which the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh to vs, and powreth ſome grace, in our hartes, &amp; tongues, to expreſſe our affection and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely the Prieſt, in the maſſe, or collect, is comon miniſter of the whole Church, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all hearers of Gods ſeruice, ſhould repoſe in the faith of the Catholick Church, for ſhe more pleaſeth God, &amp; is more acceptable to him, as a moſt beloued ſpouſe to her husband, then the fayth of any priuat men.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly the end of maſſe, and diuyne ſeruice, is common to all, whether he vnderſtand, or no, for the end of the maſſe, &amp; the Churches intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

                  <p>THe Catholick Papiſts commit no fooliſhnes, while they repeat the Angelical ſalutation, as a true prayer. The reaſon is, becauſe prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in two partes: the on is in giuing of thanks, and the other in prayer, therefore it is not affected folly, or ſuperſtition. The maior is euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are many Pſalmes of Dauid, that are only actions of thankes, and yet are nombered a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongſt Eccleſiaſticall prayers, alſo they are no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by their owne iudgement in the Pſalmiſts, &amp; in this manner were Paul, and Sylas at midnyght prayſing and praying our Lord. Act. 16. v. 25. For the petitions, &amp; deſyres are included in the prayer it ſelf. Moreouer the minor is euident, firſt becauſe,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2004:126"/>while we repeat that prayer we commemorat the benefit of our redemption, by the incarnation of the ſonne of God by way of thankes giuing, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be thought, and adiudged for a prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly it is a prayer implicit, by way of inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, as was the prayer of the leprous-man to Chriſt, ſaying: Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me cleane: Matth. 8 v 2. To whom Chriſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red condiſcending to his inward deſyre and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat prayer, ſaying: I will, be thou clean. Euen ſo in lyke manner, whyl we repeat this ſalutation, we pray-the Mother of God, to haue a care of vs implicitly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely, the holy Church hath put to this a formall and expreſſe prayer, in the end of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, ſaying holy Mother of God pray for vs, now, and in the houre of our death.

                  <p>THe Chriſtian Churches, are not only inſtitut for the preaching of the word, and miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, but chiefly for the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the vnbloody ſacrifice, and prayers, ſo that in them, in regard of, their inſtitution God is much more worſhipped, then in any other other place. Which I proue, becauſe none of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſpeaking of the Chriſtian Churches, vſeth any other word, then Templu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a Temple, ſo that a temple, is for an alter, an Altar is for a ſacrifice, &amp; therefore they were firſt inſtituted for a ſacrifice. For what els is a Temple, then a place for an Alter, &amp; what ſignifies an Alter but the place for a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? Hereupon S. Paul maketh mention of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ſaying: You cannot be partakers of the table of our Lord and of the table of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, where the Apoſtle oppoſes the Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call table, againſt the table of Diuelles: the which table was an Altar really. It followeth by the lyke reaſon, that the Chriſtian table muſt be an Altar, for it is ſayd befor, ſpeaking of immola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe the Gentils vſed to immolate, which immolation, was not done to the true God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary wiſe the Apoſtle ſignifieth, that true ſacrifices, and Altars, are offered and erected to God, for he forbiddes Chriſtians not to drinke of their drink offerings, or to eat of their meat, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molate in the Temples, and Altares of their Idols, ſeing that their worſhip can no wayes ſtand with the Chriſtian worſhip, where the cuppe and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Chriſt is, which is the ſacrifice of his owne Bleſſed body, immolat in the Temple on the Altar,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2004:129"/>and receaued of all Chriſtians, the which Altar he will not haue, to be a compagnion of Diuels, that is to ſay, that he will haue it, to haue no part with the ſacrifice of Idolaters, who offer their facrifices to Idols, of the which true ſacrifice, thoſe holy, and venerable Fathers haue left vs in remembrance theſe wordes, the ſacrifice, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, and Prieſthood of the new teſtament; as Aug. lib. 8. <hi>de ciuitate dei cap. vlt. Ambroſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>offic. cap.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Churches are inſtituted for prayer, more then preachings, for Chriſt himſelf ſayeth, Luc. 19. my houſe is the houſe of prayer, and not <q>an houſe of preaching. For this cauſe it is ſayd of the Apoſtles, who preferred prayer before do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Act. 6.

                  <p>Thirdly more eaſily God heareth the prayers of the godly, in the Church, then in any other place, becauſe the Church includeth the vniforme pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of many, as alſo the preſence of Chriſt Ieſus our mediator, both in his power, &amp; in ſpeciall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the bleſſed Sacrifice of the Altar.

The which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and conſecration is without all magick, &amp; ſuperſtition, for the fact of Iacob approueth it in the Law of nature, Gen. 28. where erecting a ſtone in title, to the vſe of a ſacrifice, &amp; powring oyle on it, for ſanctification, and in calling the place Bethel, that is to ſay, the houſe of God, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ceremonies pleaſed God, and were without all magick, &amp; ſuperſtion; euen ſo our conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Churches, &amp; Altars, is without all inchantments, or ſuperſtition; eyther explicite or implicite.

And that, that moſt clement Lord, whoſe nature is goodnes, hauing no reſpect to our good, or euill, hath decreed from eternity, to creat ſome to lyfe, ſome to death, only that in them he may declare his iuſtice, and in other his mercy, ſo that to one of thoſe endes, euery one is created, &amp; this they call predeſtination, and therefore leſt I ſhould ſeeme to forge, or counterfeyt any thing contrary to verity, it is requiſite to produce the words of their own Rabbins, to this purpoſe Cal. lib. 3. inſt. cap. 23. § 7. No man can be iuſtifyed, ſayth he, whylſt God hath forſeen what progreſſe he is to haue, that made him, and therefore God hath forſeen, becauſe by his owne decree, he hath diſpoſed what he had forſeene &amp;c.

For all are not created to alyke condition, but ſome are preordinate to lyfe, and others to eternall death, &amp; therefore whether of thoſe endes, he hapneth on, we ſay, that to that end he is predeſtinat Calu. lib. 3. inſt. cap. 21. §. 5.</q> To iuſtifie Caluin,<note place="margin">Caluins and Piſcatores blaſphemy.</note> burſt out Piſcator a Caluiniſt in his Treatiſe againſt Scaffma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> printed in, Lai in.

Let Chriſtian ears abhorre to heare ſuch doctrine,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2004:133"/>to which the Scriptures oppoſe, which teſtify that God doth not pull out the ſword of puniſhement,<note place="margin">Puniſhment and reuenge is a ſtrange work to God.</note> and reuenge, except he be compelled, and forced, by prouoking him by long continuance in ſinne. For this cauſe the prophet Iſai cap. 28. v. 21. ſayeth, <hi>That Vengeange, and the Scourge are called an vnuſuall, and a ſtrange work,</hi> and cap. 1. v. 24. as it were he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth ſaying by an interiection, <hi>ah, ah, I will caſe me of my ennemyes, &amp; I will reuenge me on my foes</hi> which interiection, Heu, many interpret it ſo, that it is againſt his will, and that he expreſſeth it with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that force vrgeth him contrary to his will to vengance, and puniſhment, who willeth all men to be ſaued, that his mercy, &amp; not his iuſtice, might be declared,<note place="margin">God is forced to puniſh man againſt his will.</note> for it is more proper to him to haue mercy, and to ſpare, then to puniſh, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge is a ſtrange work to him and contrary to his nature to be a puniſher. Is not this fully expreſſed in Gen. 6. How he was forced, when it is ſayd, that he was inwardly touched with dolour of hart, and ſayd, <hi>I will deſtroy man, whom I haue created.</hi> Lykewyſe Ezech. 18. v. 23. <hi>Is my will the death of the wicked ſayth the Lord God.</hi> Lykewyſe Sap. 1. <hi>God made not death, neyther reioyſe in the perdition of the liuing.</hi>) But by the equity of his iuſtice, when Sinners conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes not, he ſhall reioyſe exceedingly in the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſinners, for the oſtentation of his iuſtice, for his work of predeſtination is good, &amp; is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any preuiſion, or forſight of mens demerites or originall ſinne, who from eternity hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to determinate, conſtraine, force, moue, or impell the wils of any to wickednes, and ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer if the Angells, and men, from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are predeſtinated to reprobation, to the only oſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation of Gods diuyne iuſtice, they haue falne

Whereupon it followeth, that God ſhall firſt be a reuenger, before man be a ſinner, the which S. Auſten euery where reclames, that it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the infinit goodnes of God, and in ſo doing God ſhould be more cruell, then the wyld bere, and lyons; for there is no beaſt ſo ſouadge, who do intend to procread their birth and whelps to a ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame miſery, other is none, that do not nouriſh, and promote what in them lyeth, to perfection. And to the contrary God ſhalbe more vnnaturall then the brut beaſts, after the doctrine of Caluins theology. I cannot ſee by what reaſon men can promiſe, &amp; aſſure ther ſoules whether to preſume of their ſaluation, or to diſpayer in this doctrine of predeſtination. How ſhall it be in our liberty and will to perſeuer in good things, and hope to be ſaued, if predeſtination without frewill, good workes, and perſeuerance make a conſummation? what? hath Chriſt ſayd in vayne, Matth. 19. <hi>If thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Moreouer there followeth another abſurdity, that if God of his own wil, without forſeen ſinne,<note place="margin">What abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diues follow the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts doctrine of predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> doth reprobate men, there ſhalbe fewer reprobat, then elected, which is falſe, as Matth. 7. &amp; 22. by the conſequent of the Scripture is probable; for God is more propenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ready to haue mercy, then to condemne: therefore if predeſtination co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2004:134"/>in his owne will, it is to be ſuppoſed, to be fare fewer reprobat to death, then to haue been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinat to lyfe.<note place="margin">wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of his diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> For it is an idle argument that you Gather of predeſtination, to make the vindictiue iuſtice of God to ſhyne, ſeing by reaſon, it is rather obſcured: who will God firſt to be a reuenger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man, or Angell be, and to forſee and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinat them ſinners, before they be creatures, for by all reaſon, it ought to be firſt produced, what is to be puniſhed, before the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be decreed, and ſecondly the decree of the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is to be meaſured, according to the fact. So that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in election, and reprobation, conſiſteth in this diſtinction, to wit, that immediat election in perfect yeares ſubſiſt in his preſcience with preui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of following merites, preſuppoſing coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace, and mediat knowledge. And in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by preuiſed application of the Sacraments, againſt ſinne originall. Reprobation is by apoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue act of his diuyne will, by which God hath decreed to condemne ſome to eternall puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The cauſe is giuen meritorious of the part of the reprobate, to wit, perſeuerance in mortall ſinne, or in originall. For where there is a reaſon giuen, wherefore the Kingdome of God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the elect, before the beginning of the world; is there good workes, and merits, for it is ſayd, Matth. 25. that Chriſt in the day of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhall ſay,<note place="margin">Forſeen me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are cauſes of election &amp; reprobation.</note> come ye bleſſed of my Father (by prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination from eternity, and by grace in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) poſſeſſe yow the Kingdome, prepared for yow, from the beginning of the world, that is to ſay, from eternity.

Wherupon is the common maxime that the vulgares, and idiots holde, and is mantayned of all ſectaries, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> predeſtinat to eternall lyfe, howbeit he doth euill, cannot be a member of the Diueil,<note place="margin">The vulgars opinion of predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe the reprobat whatſoeuer good he doth, or how well he liue, cannot be a member of God.

Who hath permitted both the Gentils, and the Iewes to fall in infidelity, that he may haue mercy on both, as at length in this place is diſcuſſed: but as touching the wordes of the Apoſtle ſaying, when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as yet were not borne, nor had done good
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2004:137"/>oreuill. By which example it is euident, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations, nor particular perſones be elected e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, or called te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porally, or preferred to Gods fauour, by their merits, becauſe when God made theſe two perſones, he loued Iacob, and refuſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, reſpecting them both euill, and the one as guilty as the other, for originall ſinne, which was alyke in them both. And therefore iuſtly where he might haue reprobated both, he ſaued of mercy one, which one being as euill, and as voyde of good, as the other, muſt hold of Gods eternall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, mercy, and election, that he was preferred before his brother, which was elder then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and no worſe then himſelf; neyther hath his brother Eſau in the other part cauſe to complayn, for that God, neyther ſuffered anything to be don towards him, that his ſinne did not deſerue: for although God elect eternally, and giue his firſt grace without all merites, yet he doth not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, nor hate any, but for ſinne or the for ſight thereof. Therefore in theſe two equall perſones God calleth the one vnto mercy, and leaueth the other in his ſinne: Is God for this cauſe iniuſt, and an accepter of perſones? The Apoſtle anſweres, that God were not iuſt nor indifferent indeed, ſo to vſe the matter, where grace and ſaluation were dewe. As for example, if two men both beleued well, and liued well, if God ſhould giue Heauen to the one, and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uld condemne the other, then were he iniuſt, partiall, and forgetfull of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But reſpecting two, who both be worthy of damnation, (as all are, before they be called to mercy) then the matter ſtandes of meer mercy, &amp; of the Giuers will, and liberality, in which place partiality hath no place. As for example two male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2004:138"/>are condemned for one cryme, the Prince pardoneth the one, and leteth iuſtice proceed on the other: euen ſo God, ſeeing mankynd in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall condemnation, becauſe of ſinne, he ſaueth ſome, and not other ſome.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the malefactor that is pardoned, cannot attribute his remiſſion to his owne deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but to the Princes mercy: euen ſo, all that be pardoned of damnation, are delyuered by grace through the good will of God, &amp; merits of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the malefactor that is executed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chalendge the Prince, that he was not pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo, but muſt acknowledge, that he hath his deſeruing: euen ſo, ſuch as be left in the ſtate of damnation, cannot complaine, becauſe they haue their deſeruing for ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly the ſtanders by, muſt not ſay, that he was executed, becauſe the Prince would not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, for that is not the cauſe, but his offence: euen ſo, we may not ſay, that ſuch be damned, becauſe God did not pardon them, but becauſe they were offenderes, and therefore deſerued pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for there offences.</p>
                  <p>Fyftly, if they aske further, why the Prince pardoned not both, or executed not both, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that as mercy is a goodly vertue, ſo iuſtice is neceſſary and commendable, euen ſo that ſome ſhould be damned and not all pardoned, &amp; other ſome pardoned, rather then all condemned, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> agreeth to Gods iuſtice, and mercy, which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, in Gods prouidence towards vs, are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2004:143"/>my ſight by which I ſee Iohn to Runne, is not the cauſe of his courſe: euen ſo the preſcience of God of future things, maketh them not to be future<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but preſupoſes things to be futurs; ſo that theſe things, ſhould not be fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eternity of God, the foreknower of al the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our wil except ſuch things ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme were in tyme to come, neyther it is becauſe God hath for known y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to com; therfor it is come: but the contrary, becauſe God forſeeth it to come of their owne cauſes: therefore God knoweth things to come. Which grounds are ſufficient, to agree the preſcience of God, with frewill, and fortune, and this hath been the common opinion of the Fathers, ſo that now no leſſe is the liberty of freewill, or the fortunne of things, then if there ſhould be no preſcience about future effectes abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly. But it is to be obſerued, this diſtinction bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wene preſcience, and freewill, firſt I ſay by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ſimilitude, <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> it is neceſſary the Runner to moue, as it is impoſſible the ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner not to moue, for it implicates a contradiction, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree theſe two, any to runne, and not to moue; euen ſo <hi>in ſenſu compoſito:</hi> is it neceſſary that Iohn who is forſeen of God to ſinne, ſinne, for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to remayne in the preſcience of God, that Iohn ſhall ſinne, and not ſinne, becauſe theſe two cannot ſubſiſte, and conſiſt in God, that he is to forſeee a man to ſinne, and not ſinne togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But in the contrary it followeth, that, <hi>in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu diuiſo,</hi> that he who is Running may abſolutly not moue, becauſe he may not Rune: euen Iohn who is forſeen of God to ſinne, may abſolutly not ſinne, becauſe if he may not ſinne, he was not to ſinne: neyther hath he ſtand praeexiſtant in Gods preſcience, that he is to ſinne. How vngodly is the mynd of Caluin, and Beza, who ſay ſinne, and

Auſten to fauour his erroneous opinion, ſaying, I doubt not with S. Auſten ſimplicitly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that the will of God is the neceſſity of things, and that neceſſity is alſo neceſſary to be futur what he hath willed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, <q>in the 9. § he ſayth, that the reprobat would be thought excuſable in ſinning, becauſe they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Lykewyſe the Enuches are prayſed of Chriſt: Matth 19 verſ. 12. Who hath gelded themſelues <q>for the Kingdome of Heauen. In which wordes, moſt plainely Chriſt commendes pennance, and purity of lyfe, in reſpect of a more eaſy obteyning of beatitude;</q> for the end truely vnto which God hath created vs, is eternall lyfe: to which end as a mediat he hath commanded, deſtinat, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led good workes to be done, but who, (except he be more blockiſh nor a blocke, and more ſtuped nor a ſtock,) will deny mediates, which rightly Rulleth, and directes his owne end; &amp; that chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when a man is greatumly loued of God, he will giue diligence in doing the ſame which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes, for whome he vndergoeth his labours,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2004:166"/>and paines, cannot be fruſtrat of eternall lyfe, for a merite, and therefore to worke meritorious workes, for their merite, is not mercenary not baſſe, but honourable, good, and acceptable to God our Father, whoſe ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes we are if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyne our hart to doe his lawes, for a reward, and this is the good pleaſure of God, that <hi>concommina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter</hi> we ſhould worke good workes, with his grace vnto lyfe eternall, whoſe will is to remunerat &amp; gine that beatitude, for a merit of good workes.</p>

                  <p>I Say it is not anough to confide, and truſt ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citerly, but alſo with aſſured faith, we are bound to belieue good workes to merite lyfe eternall, for we cannot obtayne lyfe eternall, except we haue laboured to promerit the ſame with good works, as is euidently diſcuſſed already, notwithſtanding, no man can firmely determine, and aſſuredely perſuade him ſelf, in his merites, to obtayne and haue lyfe eternall, defacto. The reaſon is, becauſe we are not certaine of our owne righteouſnes, &amp; that any man is iuſt abſolutly, and to haue merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious workes, and howbeit he might in ſome part
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:2004:166"/>repoſe confidently to haue, notwithſtanding it followeth, that no man aſſuredly can aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of perſeuerance, and therefore ſeing no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way, any man can be certayne in this lyfe, (without a ſpeciall reuelation of God, or els, if we would precipitat our ſelues in the damnable golfe of the Caluiniſts only fayth) We belieue vnder ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, <hi>ſub gratia,</hi> giuing diligence to make our calling <q>and election ſure by good workes, as the Apoſtle teaches, 2. Peter. 2. and ſo we may conceaue of our good workes, ſome truſt, and confidence, of eternall glory: notwithſtanding ſo, that chiefly the ſame confidence, and truſt, be placed depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in the only mercies of God, and merites of Chriſt, and ſecou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dely in workes.</q> And therefore <q>to the purpoſe, the firſt part is proued, Tob. 4. v. 12. Great confidence is with almeſſe before the moſt high-God to all them that doth the ſame.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lykewyſe 1. Tim. 3. v. 13. ſayth, who haue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred <q>weell purches to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues a good place, &amp; much confidence in fayth. And ſeing good works, are the cauſe of our ſaluation, already proued, we may the more rightly truſt, and confide them to obtayne our ſaluation: as for example when the Phiſick is very good, the patient may the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide of his health: and therefore in ſuch manner I may confide, that merites are the cauſe, of which ſaluation may come, and ſo conſequently we may haue that confidence, and truſt of good vvorkes, as an effect depending on the cauſe.</q> Secou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly the poſterior part is prouen of the for ſayd introductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe the chiefe cauſe of our ſaluation, is the merites of Chriſt, and Gods diuyne mercy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the merites of Chriſt, vertue is giuen vs to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:2004:167"/>merite, and to be perſeuerand: So that our merits are the workes of Chriſt, which he worketh in vs by the ſpirit of his grace, which no man is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, forſomuch as in all our petitions, &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers we remite them to be graunted for his diuine mercy ſaike, and the merite of Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Church, and euery member con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes their prayer, ſaying, by our Lord IESVS Chriſt, &amp;c.
